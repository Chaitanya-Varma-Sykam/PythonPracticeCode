    "NumPy, which is short for Numerical Python (created by Travis Oliphant in 2005), is one of the main packages for carrying out scientific calculations using Python. For this class, NumPy is important because `scikit-learn`, the machine learning package we will be using, uses the NumPy array as the fundamental data structure. This tutorial offers a quick introduction to NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is attractive to the scientific community because it provides a convenient Python interface for working with multi-dimensional array data structures efficiently; the NumPy array data structure is also called `ndarray`, which is short for *n*-dimensional array. For our purposes, we will mostly be working with 1- and 2-dimensional arrays.\n",

Intuitively, we can think of a one-dimensional NumPy array as a data structure to represent a vector of elements -- you may think of it as a fixed-size Python list where all elements share the same type (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` or `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`). Similarly, we can think of a two-dimensional array as a data structure to represent a matrix or a Python list of lists. \n",
